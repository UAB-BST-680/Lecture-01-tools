## Problem 1

- Welcome to your group!

- Spend 5 minutes chatting and getting to know your teammates!

## Problem 2

- Get some practice working with `gt`

- Use what you learned in the intro to markdown file to create the table below:

**Hints**: 

- I am using rows 1, 2, 3, 51, 52, 53, 101, 102, and 103 of the `iris` dataset.

- The `iris` dataset is already loaded in your R environment. No need to import it.


```{r}

library(gt)
readr::read_rds('iris_table.rds')

```
